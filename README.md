# Data Analytical and Machine Learning Tool 

## Our Team: 
1. Ayush Raina (Project Lead): handled most of the Backend part of this Project (Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru, Maths and Computing)
2. Aastha Verma (Design) : handled all the designing(Frontend) of the Project (Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi, Computer Science and Engineering)
3. Srijan : helped in managing tasks and finding errors (Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru, Maths and Computing)

## Aim
With this tool anyone who does not have any knowledge of Machine Learning will be able to train Machine Learning models and can make predictions on his/her new data. We have tried our best to make the layout of this tool very simple and attractive. You will just require a dataset to get started with. This tool is packed with numerous other features for Data Analysis. You can even plot a number of graphs to visualize the data, its trends and patterns.

## Setup and Installation
1. First of all you need to bring the project to your system, for that you can type this into your terminal,  "git clone https://github.com/ayushraina2028/Data-Analytics-and-Machine-Learning-Tool.git".  After hitting ENTER, whole thing will be cloned into your system.
2. Now its time to install the dependencies that are listed in requirements, you just need to type this in your terminal, "pip install -r requirements.txt". Now all the dependencies will be automatically installed in your system
3. To start with, we have already provided 2 datasets in the files, one is for Classification Problem statement(winequalityN.csv) and other is for Regression Problem statement(real Estate.csv)
4. Now we are ready to get started just run the app.py file by run button in vs code directly or type this into your terminal, "python app.py" and it will run your file, it will take few seconds to run after that it will give 3 links, click on 3rd one in your Browser.
